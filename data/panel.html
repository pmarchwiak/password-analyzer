<h4>Duplicates</h4>
<p>Reusing passwords is less safe than using unique passwords. If an attacker 
learns your password for one account (through hacking or by guessing), he/she
is likely to use it to break into another account.
</p>
<h4>Common passwords</h4>
<p>Some passwords such as "password" and "1234" are very popular and thus can
be easily guessed by attackers. Avoid using passwords that are common dictionary
words or sequences of letters or numbers.</p>
<h4>Complexity</h4>
<p>A common recommendation for creating a strong a password is to ensure that it
is at least 8 characters long, and is combination of lowercase and uppercase
letters, digits, and special characters. This add-on considers passwords with
entropy lower than 52 to be "too simple" where entropy is calculated as <br />
log<sub>2</sub>(alphabet_size<sup>password_length</sup>)
